Hello! I’m Michael Magcamit, Lecturer in Security Studies in the School of History Politics and International Relations (HyPIR) at the University of Leicester. Before joining HyPIR in June 2021 I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the Queen Mary University of London (2019-2021) and where I am also currently a Visiting Research Fellow (2021-2023). Prior to moving to the UK in 2019 I was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Musashi University in Tokyo Japan (2016-2019) and taught International Relations courses on a joint program between the University of London (LSE) and Musashi. I am the author of, among others, _Ethnoreligious Otherings and Passionate Conflicts_ (OUP 2022) and _Small Powers and Trading Security_ (Palgrave/Springer 2016).

My area of expertise is International Security, specifically on issues concerning Conflict and Peace, International Trade and Development, and Foreign Policy with a specialist focus on the Asia-Pacific.
